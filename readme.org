I have no idea about Emacs requirements. Guessing at least 25.

** Installation

Note: I have only tried this on macOS, so it might not work on other platforms. Open an issue if it fails miserably

#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://github.com/bendiksolheim/.emacs.d
# Open Emacs, wait until things are installed
# In emacs:
M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts
#+END_SRC
