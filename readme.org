* .emacs.d

Evil based Emacs config. Uses [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][req-package]] to load packages and handle dependencies.

** Requirements

I have no idea about Emacs requirements. Guessing at least 25.

** Installation

Note: I have only tried this on macOS, so it might not work on other platforms. Open an issue if it fails miserably

git clone https://github.com/bendiksolheim/.emacs.d
# Open Emacs, wait till things are installed
# In emacs:
M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts
